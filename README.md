# API Testing

These are some API endpoints manually tested using Postman, a special tool for API testing. I made more test with different parameters for every endpoint, in order to verify and practice Positive and Negative testing on APIs. </br>
The project was carried out from https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com</br>
All operations were carried out CRUD.</br>

## RestfulBooker
** Get All Booking ID's**
__

Returns the IDs of all the bookings that exist within the API. I have verified with test snippets if the response code is 200, the response time, and if the body matches the string. The env is a variable for the URL </br>
